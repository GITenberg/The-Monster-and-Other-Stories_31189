description: 'The Blue hotel: "As the story opens, three visitors find shelter from
  a blizzard at Pat Scully''s hotel in Fort Romper, Neb.: a nervous New Yorker known
  as the Swede, a rambunctious Westerner named Bill, and a reserved Easterner called
  Mr. Blanc. The Swede becomes increasingly drunk, defensive, and reckless. He beats
  Scully''s son, Johnnie, in a fight after accusing him of cheating at cards. When
  the Swede accosts a patron of a bar, he is stabbed and killed. The story ends ambiguously
  at a point several months later, when timid Mr. Blanc confesses to Bill that he
  feels somewhat responsible for the Swede''s death because he failed to act when
  he saw that Johnnie was indeed cheating at cards." --Encyclop√¶dia Britannica website.'
